  <h1>About Me!</h1>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="item">
        <p>I started woodworking when I was about 6, following my dad around the garage to &quot;help&quot;. As I got older, I had ideas of my own that we worked on together until I knew my way around the shop enough to make a few things myself. One summer I wanted to experiment with combining wood burning and stains on a box we were making together. It didn&apos;t exactly go smoothly, but it worked, so I used that method to make gifts for my friends and family, slowly perfecting the process and learning with each project. Eventually my Dad got tired of sizing and framing my &quot;canvases&quot; all the way from Michigan, so he got me a few of my own tools. I had graduated, was waiting for my job to hire me back, and bored out of my mind, so I jumped in head first with new art designs. I started at farmer&apos;s markets and then Christmas shows, eventually shifting to laser-engraving to keep up with demand. </p>

I started at farmer&apos;s markets and then Christmas shows, eventually shifting to laser-engraving to keep up with demand. However, I got more and more interested in exotic woods and the wonderful colors that nature is capable of. I started making pendants, earrings and cutting boards to work with more interesting species than pine and was amazed and the beautiful natural colors. Although now that I&apos;m in year 3, I&apos;d have to say that I love working with exotic woods as much as I love making new art pieces.</p>
